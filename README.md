# Generating realistic background traffic on GENI


## Background


## Results

## Run my experiment



### Set up topology

This section should include:

* Reserve topology using my Rspec (modify to not include sink nodes). Note that it uses a raw PC, not all aggregates will have one available
* Wait for it to come up and log in
* Set up extra disk space on tcpreplay node
* Add static ARP entries on router
* Get the replaywrapper script from Github: use wget with sudo, specify argument to save in /usr/local/bin, and then run: `sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/replaywrapper`

### Acquire dataset

This section should include:

* describe the VPN/non-VPN dataset and its advantages, explain how to get access to it. Also show how to unzip it and what you would see if you did.
* describe the MAWI dataset and its advantages, explain how to download and unzip it.

### Play back background traffic
